## Maps for Fabulous.MauiControls

[![build](https://github.com/fsharp-mobile/Fabulous.MauiControls.Maps/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fsharp-mobile/Fabulous.MauiControls.Maps/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml) [![Fabulous.MauiControls.Maps NuGet version](https://badge.fury.io/nu/Fabulous.MauiControls.Maps.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/nu/Fabulous.MauiControls.Maps) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/716980335593914419?label=discord&logo=discord)](https://discord.gg/bpTJMbSSYK)

The Map control is a cross-platform view for displaying and annotating maps. You can find all the details about this control on the [.NET MAUI Maps documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/platform-integration/appmodel/maps).

### How to use

1. Add the [Fabulous.MauiControls.Maps package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Fabulous.MauiControls.Maps) to your project.

2. Add `.UseFabulousMaps()` to your `MauiProgram` after `.UseFabulousApp()`.

```f#
open Fabulous.MauiControls.Maps

type MauiProgram =
    static member CreateMauiApp() =
        MauiApp
            .CreateBuilder()
            .UseFabulousApp(App.program)
            .UseFabulousMaps()
            (...)
            .Build()
```

2. Open Fabulous.MauiControls.Maps at the top of the file where you declare your Fabulous program (eg. Program.stateful).

```f#
open Fabulous.MauiControls.Maps
```

3. Depending on which platform you're targeting, you might need to do some configuration before the map widget will work. See "Initialization and Configuration" down below.

### Initialization and Configuration
The Map widget will be rendered by the native map controls of each platform depending on the device you're running on. Some of those platforms require that you make some configuration before being able to use the `Map` widget.

Please follow the .NET MAUI documentation to learn about the requirements: [.NET MAUI Map Get Started](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/platform-integration/appmodel/maps#get-started)

### Usage
This package adds several widgets for you to use:
- `Map(region: MapSpan)` : Displays a map centered on the position specified
- `MapWithPins(region: MapSpan) { MapPin; MapPin; ... }` : Displays a map with some pins on it

To learn more about the capabilities of the Map and MapWithPins widgets, see [.NET MAUI Map Control](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/platform-integration/appmodel/maps).

```f#
Map(MapSpan.FromCenterAndRadius(Position(47.640663, -122.1376177), Distance.FromMiles(250.)))
    .hasZoomEnabled(true)
    .hasScrollEnabled(true)
    .mapType(MapType.Street)
    .isShowingUser(true)
    .isTrafficEnabled(true)
    .onMapClicked (MapClicked)
```
```f#
let position = Position(36.9628066, -122.0194722)
let mapSpan = MapSpan(position, 0.01, 0.01)

(MapWithPins(mapSpan) {
    MapPin(position)
        .address("My Address1")
        .label("I'm a marker1")
        .pinType(PinType.Place)
        .onMarkerClicked(MarkerClicked)
        .onInfoWindowClicked (MarkerClicked)

    MapPin(Position(36.9641949, -122.0177232))
        .address("My Address2")
        .label("I'm a marker1")
        .pinType(PinType.Place)
        .onMarkerClicked(MarkerClicked)
        .onInfoWindowClicked (MarkerClicked)
})
```
It is also possible to draw shapes directly on the map using the `.mapElements() { ... }` modifier.  
It supports several shapes: `MapCircle`, `MapPolygon`, `MapPolyline`.

```f#
Map(MapSpan.FromCenterAndRadius(Position(47.640663, -122.1376177), Distance.FromMiles(1.)))
    .mapElements () {
        // Draw a polygon on the map
        MapPolygon(
            [ Position(47.6458676, -122.1356007)
              Position(47.6458097, -122.142789)
              Position(47.6367593, -122.1428104)
              Position(47.6368027, -122.1398707)

              Position(47.6458676, -122.1356007) ]
        )
            .strokeWidth(8.)
            .fillColor(Color.Red.ToFabColor())
            .strokeColor (Color.Blue.ToFabColor())
            
        // Draw a circle on the map
        MapCircle(Position(37.79752, -122.40183), Distance(250.))
            .fillColor(Color.FromHex("#88FFC0CB").ToFabColor())
            .strokeColor(Color.FromHex("#88FF0000").ToFabColor())
            .strokeWidth (8.)
            
        // Draw a polyline on the map
        MapPolyline(
            [ Position(47.6381401, -122.1317367)
              Position(47.6381473, -122.1350841)

              Position(47.6414148, -122.1418647)
              Position(47.6414654, -122.1432702) ]
        )
            .strokeColor(Color.Blue.ToFabColor())
            .strokeWidth (12.)
